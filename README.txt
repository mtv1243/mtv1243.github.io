 This is a one page website made to promote the Suicide Buddies Podcast made by Hampton Yount and Dave Ross. 
 They're two comedians who have dealt with depression for a long time and so decided to talk openly about what 
 makes their depression harder or easier to manage. Also every episode includes an investigation into a famous 
 suicide in history. You should listen to it anywhere podcasts are streamed!
